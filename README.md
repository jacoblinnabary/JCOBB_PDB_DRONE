Overview
This project is a custom power distribution and control board designed for a small personal drone build. The PCB handles high-current battery routing to an external 40A ESC while providing a clean mounting and control platform for an Arduino Nano. The Nano generates PWM signals for the ESC and optionally handles additional sensor inputs or flight-related logic.

Features

High-current power corridor for battery → ESC with support for burst currents up to 40A

Optimized for 1 oz copper using wide pours and via-stitched layers

Supports 12 AWG wire input/output pads

Integrated Arduino Nano footprint for control logic and PWM generation

Optional connectors for signals, auxiliary power, and expansion

Designed entirely in KiCad, with all source files included

Purpose
This board simplifies wiring, reduces mess, and provides a mechanically solid mounting point for both the microcontroller and the high-current ESC connections in a compact drone platform.
